# JavaScript Exam - 06.12.2020

<h1>:airplane: Destinations</h1>
This is my submission for the JS Application course exam in SoftUni.
It's a single page application for creating tourist destinations to a city in a country.

# :hammer_and_wrench: I used:
- Javascript
- Sammy JS for routing
- Handlebars for templating
- Firebase for database and authorization
